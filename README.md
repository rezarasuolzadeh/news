## News
This is a small and simple android app that it's UI made by Jetpack Compose. I use the [GNews API](https://gnews.io/) in this app, it can make only 100 request every day (because of GNews limit ðŸ™ƒ). The program works with an API for headline news, which is fetch every time the app is launched.
